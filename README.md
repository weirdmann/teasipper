# Teasipper
A simple, lightweight TCP library for GO.
Designed for educational purposes, this library is not intended for production use.


Although it might as well be, as it is quite fast and efficient :D 

But really, don't use it in production. It's not thoroughly tested yet.

But also it's really fast and efficient.

It's built on top of the standard `net` package, and provides a simple API for creating and managing TCP connections.
It is designed with GO's concurrency model in mind, and uses channels to communicate between the user and the TCP endpoints.
